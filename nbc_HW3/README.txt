Nothing special as far as compiling goes. My task1 is a simple snake js + html code and pretty much the same with my node.js
If you have a decent IDE you could just open and run it or however you prefer.

Note: I say it within the snake.html webpage but, I do have my js set to take in the arrow keys as input as well as the buttons.
